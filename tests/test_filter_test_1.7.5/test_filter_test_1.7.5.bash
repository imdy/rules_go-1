# This script checks that --test_filter works with go_test when using
# Go 1.7.5. The generated test driver is different for Go 1.8, due to
# incompatible upstream changes in the testing package.
#
# This is a manual test because it requires downloading Go 1.7.5. This
# should be run manually when go_repositories or generate_test_main change.
